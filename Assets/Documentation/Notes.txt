Notes about developments of the project.

To get VG do one of the following alternatives:

    Option 1: Implement 3 small VG level features
    Option 2: Implement 1 small VG level feature and 1 medium VG level feature
    Option 3: Implement 1 large VG level feature.

    Terrain
        - TODO - (G) Basic Unity terrain or primitives will suffice for a level
        - UNSURE - (VG, large) Destructible terrain (You can use Unity's built in terrain or your own custom solution)

        - DONE - (G) Use the built in Character Controller. Add jumping.
